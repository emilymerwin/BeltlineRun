##Beltline Run
- Ben gave me his photos directly, Jill put hers into SCC and attached to budget item so she could caption them. iPhone GPS data worked great. Used Picasa to edit GPS coods visually.
- Create a photoshop batch to resize images
- createGeoJSON.py opens folder of images and creates GeoJSON formatted using metadata GPS coords and captions. Note: conversion is required to tranform the iPhone's GPS degree system to the decimal system
- The .GPX file generated by Ben's Garmin watch had way more points than we needed, simplified it using [mapshaper.org](http://www.mapshaper.org/) - I only ended up needing 5% of the original points. [Simplify.js](http://mourner.github.io/simplify-js/) also looks interesting and is built on Leaflet.
- The Storymap branch attempted to use that library but I couldn't figure out how to access the leaflet methods from the stormap so I scrapped it

###Dependencies
 - [Python Image Library (PIL) Pillow](https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow) for accessing photo metadata
 - [MapBox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v1.6.2/)
 
##ToDo
 - [X] create line with Ben's Garmin data
